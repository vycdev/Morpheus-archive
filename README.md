# Morpheus

An all purpose discord bot for everyone. 

# About

This bot was created to complement the existance of [Codify](https://github.com/CCodeCommunity/Codify) and as a rewrite of it, since that the code of Codify is already getting old and messy I hope that this will be a more general purpose bot that is not focused on only one community. Of course I will not abandon Codify entirely, since it's easy for me to add new features, but contributing to it, for other people, has proven to be rather difficult because of the setup, which made some people give up on doing it, Morpheus, hopefully will be a lot easier to set up and contribute to. I will also try to bring all of the functionality of Codify to Morpheus and much more.

## Contributing
